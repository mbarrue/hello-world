# hello-world
First Github repository (TEST)

Curious, independent, resilient, versatile an creative, I feel naturally comfortable in unknown
scenarios.
I am generally positive about new challenges, as these allow us to improve ourselves and
develop new skills. sait that, it keeps me motivated to work in dynamic fast-paced environments,
feeling i am allowed to take initiative on projects or tasks while solving new problems appearing.
working surrounded by great co-workers is also priceless.

During my career, i have covered different areas inside the business intelligence area: - data
modelling - data warehouse/etl development - business intelligence tools - datamining - sql -
data analysis - project management
